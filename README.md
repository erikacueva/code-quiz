# code-quiz
## Task
The goal of this assignment was to create a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals. The code did not meet the goal of the objective, however. The timer is not functional, nor can the user select the answer to the first and subsequent questions. The new goal for the coder is to rewrite the code such that all JavaScript functions are operational. 
## Next Steps
The coder will review the steps necessary to write functional JavaScript code.
